    "text": "On average, police in the United States shoot and kill more than 1,000 people every year, according to an ongoing analysis by The Washington Post.\n\n\nProposal\nWe propose a case study to explore the relationship between police residence and fatal police shootings, employing advanced data science methodologies. Focusing on officers residing in the cities they serve, our project aims to uncover insights and patterns that contribute to a nuanced understanding of this complex issue.\n\nObjectives:\n\nInvestigate the correlation between police residence and fatal police shootings.\nUtilize a comprehensive dataset spanning 2015 to 2023, focusing on police agencies involved in at least one fatal shooting.\nApply advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and potential biases.\nExamine disparities in incident rates based on officers’ residency status, considering demographic, socioeconomic, and policing variables.\n\nMethodology:\n\nData Collection:\n\nCompile a dataset comprising information on police agencies involved in fatal police shootings.\nCompile a data set of census variables such as officer residency, race, community demographics, and departmental policies.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nEmploy advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to discern patterns and correlations.\nConduct a comprehensive exploration of variables influencing fatal police shootings.\n\n\nHypothesis and Expected Outcomes:\nWe will conduct two hypothesis tests to analyze both;\n\nthe nominal relationship between an increasing proportion of in-city officer residency and number of fatal police shooting deaths and\nthe categorical difference in fatal police shooting deaths between cities where a majority or or minority of police officers live in the city.\n\n\nInference for a Difference in Proportions\n\n\\(H_0\\): The mean total number of fatal shootings per agencies does not differ based on if a majority of the officers live in the city or not.\n\\(H_A\\): The mean total number of fatal shootings per agencies is fewer in cities where a majority of the officers live in the city then cities where they do not.\n\n\\(H_0 : p\\_{maj} − p\\_{min} = 0\\), or equivalently \\(H_0 : p\\_{maj} = p\\_{min}\\)\n\\(H_A : p\\_{maj} − p\\_{min} &lt; 0\\), or equivalently \\(H_A : p\\_{maj} &lt; p\\_{min}\\)\n\n\nInference for a Correlation\n\n\\(H_O\\): There is no relationship between percentage of the total police force that lives in the city they serve and number of fatal shootings.\n\\(H_A\\): There is a relationship between percentage of the total police force that lives in the city they serve and number of fatal shootings.\n\n\\(H_0 : \\rho = 0\\)\n\\(H_0 : \\rho \\neq 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post Fatal Force Database\nIn 2015, The Washington Post began tracking details about each police-involved killing in the United States — the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the person was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by manually culling local news reports, collecting information from law enforcement websites and social media, and monitoring independent databases such as Fatal Encounters and the now-defunct Killed by Police project. In many cases, The Post conducts additional reporting.\nIn 2022, The Post updated its database to standardize and publish the names of the police agencies involved in each shooting to better measure accountability at the department level.\nThe 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. began a protest movement culminating in the Black Lives Matter movement and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. In this data set, The Post tracks only shootings with circumstances closely paralleling those like the killing of Brown — incidents in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths in this data set.\nThe FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. Since 2015, The Post has documented more than twice as many fatal shootings by police as recorded by federal officials on average annually. That gap has widened in recent years, as the FBI in 2021 tracked only a third of departments’ fatal shootings.\n\n\nMost Police Don’t Live In The Cities They Serve\nIn Ferguson, Missouri, where protests lamented for months following the shooting of a teenager by a police officer this month, more than two-thirds of the civilian population is black. Only 11 percent of the police force is. The racial disparity is troubling enough on its own, but it’s also suggestive of another type of misrepresentation. Given Ferguson’s racial gap, it’s likely that many of its police officers live outside city limits.\nIf so, Ferguson would have something in common with most major American cities. In about two-thirds of the U.S. cities with the largest police forces, the majority of police officers commute to work from another town.\nOn average among the 75 American cities with the largest police forces, 49 percent of black police officers and 47 percent of Hispanic officers live within the city limits. But just 35 percent of white police officers do. The disparity is starkest in cities with largely black populations. In Detroit, for example, 57 percent of black police officers live in the city but just 8 percent of white ones do. Memphis, Tennessee; Baltimore; Birmingham, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi — also majority black — likewise have large racial gaps in where their police officers live."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis case study investigates the intricate relationship between police residence and fatal police shootings, employing a data science approach to uncover insights and patterns within the context of law enforcement agencies. Focused on police officers residing in the cities they serve, the study examines whether this residency factor correlates with the incidence of fatal police shootings. The data set, spanning the years 2015 to 2023, is composed of information on police agencies involved in at least one fatal shooting, and is subjected to rigorous analysis using advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques.\nThis study aims to discern patterns, trends, and potential biases associated with the geographical proximity of police officers to the communities they police. A comprehensive exploration of demographic, socioeconomic, and policing variables contributes to a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing fatal police shootings. Furthermore, the study seeks to identify any disparities in incident rates based on officers’ residency status, considering variables such as race, community demographics, and departmental policies.\nThe insights derived from this case study bear substantial implications for informing public policy, refining police training protocols, and strengthening community relations. By unraveling the nuanced dynamics surrounding police residence and fatal police shootings, this case study aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to enhance transparency, accountability, and trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. In doing so, it contributes to the broader discourse on police reform, fostering a data-driven approach to address critical issues and promote safer, more resilient communities."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nGeneral Conclusions\nThis comprehensive case study delves into the complex interplay between police force in-city residence and fatal police shootings, utilizing a data-driven approach to unearth patterns and insights within the realm of law enforcement agencies. Focused on the residency status of police officers in the cities they serve, the study scrutinizes whether this factor is correlated with the occurrence of fatal police shootings. Covering the years 2015 to 2023 and incorporating information on police agencies involved in at least one fatal shooting, the research employs advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to provide a nuanced understanding of the phenomenon.\n\n\nKey Findings\nThe analysis reveals a negative association between the percentage of officer residency in a city and the number of fatal shootings, suggesting that, on average, a higher proportion of in-city officer residency is associated with fewer fatal police shootings. However, correlation is not equal to causation so we conducted a multiple linear regression. When controlling for victim armament, the study identifies a complex relationship. While an increase in the percentage of officer residency is associated with fewer fatal shootings, the presence of an armed victim is linked to a significant increase in fatal shootings.\nOur hypothesis tests provide insights into the statistical significance of the observed relationships; a difference in mean number of shootings per agency in cities where a majority or minority of officers reside in the city and the nominal relationship (correlation) between an increasing proportion of in-city officer residency and number of fatal police shooting death. The first test suggests that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis regarding the difference in mean total fatal shootings between agencies with a majority and minority of officers residing in the city. The second test indicates a significant relationship between the percentage of officer residency and the number of fatal shootings.\n\n\nLimitations and Considerations and Improvements for Future Study\nIt’s essential to acknowledge the limitations of this study. The analysis relies on available data, and causation cannot be inferred from correlation. Factors beyond the scope of this study may influence fatal police shootings, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to police reform.\nThe accuracy and completeness of the data used in the analysis are dependent on the quality of reporting by law enforcement agencies. Incomplete or inaccurate reporting could introduce biases. The study spans the years 2015 to 2023. Changes in law enforcement practices or societal dynamics over time may not be adequately captured. There may be confounding variables not included in the analysis that could influence the relationship between police residence and fatal police shootings besides residency as we demonstrated in the study.\nThe study may not account for geographical variations in policing practices. Policing approaches can differ significantly between urban and rural areas, and this variability might affect the observed relationships. The analysis does not control for the population size of the cities being studied. Fatal shootings per agency per capita might provide a more nuanced understanding of the impact on communities. While the study considers the victim’s armament status, the context of each shooting, such as the immediacy of threat and the perceived level of danger, is not fully explored. This nuance could impact the outcomes.\nIf we had more time, it would be wise to recompile data with information from the 2020 census. It would also be wise to control for city population in future studies, fatal shootings per capita.\n\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nThe findings of this case study carry substantial implications for policy-making, police training, and community relations. The evidence suggests that fostering a higher percentage of officer residency in the communities they police may contribute to a reduction in fatal police shootings. However, it’s crucial to consider other influential factors, such as victim armament, when formulating comprehensive policies.\nImplement measures to enhance transparency and accountability within law enforcement agencies, including the regular monitoring of fatal shooting incidents and the factors influencing them. Encourage community policing strategies that promote stronger bonds between officers and the communities they serve. Initiatives to increase the percentage of officers residing in their assigned cities may contribute to building trust. Prioritize training programs that focus on de-escalation techniques and handling situations involving armed individuals. This can mitigate the escalation of incidents and reduce the likelihood of fatal outcomes. Policy makers and researchers should also promote ongoing research and data collection to monitor trends and assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Continued analysis will help refine policies and ensure adaptability to evolving community needs.\nIn conclusion, this case study contributes to the ongoing discourse on police reform by providing evidence-based insights into the relationship between police residence and fatal police shootings. By addressing these critical issues, we aspire to foster safer, more resilient communities and facilitate positive transformations in law enforcement practices."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Each day researchers at The Post identify and manually record data for fatal police shootings in the United States. Each record requires at least two sources and must be approved by our editors before being publicly released.\nData about each fatal shooting is provided via two comma-separated value (CSV) files:\nDeath Record data for each victim and incident is included in /v2/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv.\nNew in v2 is a second Agencies csv, /v2/fatal-police-shootings-agencies.csv, which contains data for police agencies involved in at least one fatal police shooting since 2015. The agencies csv has a field called agency_ids, which can be used to associate each death record with the agencies involved.\nTo enable joining this dataset with other federal law enforcement datasets, in 2022 The Post undertook an effort to increase the coverage of federal Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) codes recorded for agencies in the database. Using agency data from the FBI and Department of Justice, reporters did a combination of automated and manual name and ORI code matching to fill in missing ORI code data. They also standardized department names. Agency naming, organization, hierarchy and classification varies from state to state. For this reason, sub-agencies and local troops, regions and posts have been aggregated into their parent agencies, meaning that in some cases an individual agency will have multiple associated ORI codes. For instance, a state police department may have the ORI codes of multiple barracks associated with it.\n\n\nThe Post created version 2 of this dataset in 2022 to refine and better define data categories, as well as improve documentation about how the data is obtained and classified. In addition to the altering of fields and formatting, a separate agencies dataset has been added which includes information on the law enforcement agencies which have been involved in at least one fatal shooting since 2015.\nHigh-level summary of major changes to the data schema introduced in version 2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV1 field\nV2 Field\nContext\n\n\n\n\nmanner_of_death\nfield removed\nThis database tracks fatal police shootings.

in-city residency (all) is \\(0\\). For each one-unit increase in the percentage of officer residency, the number of fatal shootings is expected to decrease by \\(0.5874\\) (\\(-0.5874\\)) units, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n\nThis model suggests that there is a negative association between the percentage of officer residency and the number of fatal shootings. However, it’s important to interpret the results in the context of your data and consider potential confounding factors, like whether or not the victim was armed.\nThe model equation for fit_multi considering victim armament (armed) is:\n[ = 4.117 + 1.211 + 24.921 ]\n\nThe intercept, \\(4.117\\), is the estimated number of fatal shootings where the percentage of officer in-city residency (all) is \\(0\\) and the victim was un-armed. For each one-unit increase in the percentage of in-city officer residency compared to the total force (all), we expect an increase of \\(1.211\\) fatal shootings, assuming the victim’s armament status (armedYES) remains constant.\nThe coefficient for ‘armedYES’, \\(24.921\\), indicates that the victim is armed (armed is YES), we expect an increase of \\(24.921\\) fatal shootings compared to when the victim is not armed (armed is No), assuming the percentage of officer residency (all) remains constant.\n\nIn summary, the model suggests that the percentage of officer residency and whether the victim is armed are associated with the number of fatal shootings per agency even as we control for victim armament. However, as correlation does not imply causation, and other factors not included in the model may influence the outcomes.\n\n#generate null distribution\nnull_dist &lt;- agencies_census |&gt;\n  specify(n ~ majority) |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in means\", order = c(\"TRUE\", \"FALSE\"))\n\n#compute observed test statistic\ntest_stat &lt;- agencies_census |&gt;\n  specify(n ~ majority) |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in means\", order = c(\"TRUE\", \"FALSE\"))\n\n#visualize p-value\nnull_dist |&gt;\n  visualize() +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = test_stat, direction = \"less\")\n\n\n\n#compute p-value\n  null_dist |&gt;\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = test_stat, direction = \"less\")\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_value\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   0.225\n\n\nInference for a Difference in Means\n\n\\(H_0\\): The mean total number of fatal shootings per agencies does not differ based on if a majority of the officers live in the city or not.\n\\(H_A\\): The mean total number of fatal shootings per agencies is fewer in cities where a majority of the officers live in the city then cities where they do not.\n\n– \\(H_0 : \\mu_{maj} − \\mu_{min} = 0\\), or equivalently \\(H_0 : \\mu_{maj} = \\mu_{min}\\) – \\(H_A : \\mu_{maj} − \\mu_{min} &lt; 0\\), or equivalently \\(H_A : \\mu_{maj} &lt; \\mu_{min}\\)\n\n#generate null distribution\nnull_dist_cor &lt;- agencies_census |&gt;\n  specify(n ~ white) |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"correlation\")\n\n#compute observed test statistic\ntest_stat_cor &lt;- agencies_census |&gt;\n  specify(n ~ white) |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"correlation\")\ntest_stat_cor\n\nResponse: n (numeric)\nExplanatory: white (numeric)\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n     stat\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.0470\n\n#visualize p-value\nnull_dist_cor |&gt;\n  visualize() +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = test_stat, direction = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n\n#compute p-value\nnull_dist_cor |&gt;\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = test_stat, direction = \"two.sided\")\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_value\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       0\n\n\nInference for a Correlation\n\n\\(H_O\\): There is no relationship between percentage of the total police force that lives in the city they serve and number of fatal shootings.\n\\(H_A\\): There is a relationship between percentage of the total police force that lives in the city they serve and number of fatal shootings.\n\n\\(H_0 : \\rho = 0\\)\n\\(H_0 : \\rho \\neq 0\\)"
