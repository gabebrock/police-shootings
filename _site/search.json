    "text": "WaPo Fatal Force Database\nIn 2015, The Washington Post began tracking details about each police-involved killing in the United States — the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the person was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by manually culling local news reports, collecting information from law enforcement websites and social media, and monitoring independent databases such as Fatal Encounters and the now-defunct Killed by Police project. In many cases, The Post conducts additional reporting.\nIn 2022, The Post updated its database to standardize and publish the names of the police agencies involved in each shooting to better measure accountability at the department level.\nThe 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. began a protest movement culminating in the Black Lives Matter movement and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. In this data set, The Post tracks only shootings with circumstances closely paralleling those like the killing of Brown — incidents in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths in this data set.\nThe FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. Since 2015, The Post has documented more than twice as many fatal shootings by police as recorded by federal officials on average annually. That gap has widened in recent years, as the FBI in 2021 tracked only a third of departments’ fatal shootings.\n#Most Police Don’t Live In The Cities They Serve\nIn Ferguson, Missouri, where protests lamented for months following the shooting of a teenager by a police officer this month, more than two-thirds of the civilian population is black. Only 11 percent of the police force is. The racial disparity is troubling enough on its own, but it’s also suggestive of another type of misrepresentation. Given Ferguson’s racial gap, it’s likely that many of its police officers live outside city limits.\nIf so, Ferguson would have something in common with most major American cities. In about two-thirds of the U.S. cities with the largest police forces, the majority of police officers commute to work from another town.\nOn average among the 75 American cities with the largest police forces, 49 percent of black police officers and 47 percent of Hispanic officers live within the city limits. But just 35 percent of white police officers do. The disparity is starkest in cities with largely black populations. In Detroit, for example, 57 percent of black police officers live in the city but just 8 percent of white ones do. Memphis, Tennessee; Baltimore; Birmingham, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi — also majority black — likewise have large racial gaps in where their police officers live."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This case study investigates the intricate relationship between police residence and fatal police shootings, employing a data science approach to uncover insights and patterns within the context of law enforcement agencies. Focused on police officers residing in the cities they serve, the study examines whether this residency factor correlates with the incidence of fatal police shootings. The data set, spanning the years 2015 to 2023, is composed of information on police agencies involved in at least one fatal shooting, and is subjected to rigorous analysis using advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques.\nThis study aims to discern patterns, trends, and potential biases associated with the geographical proximity of police officers to the communities they police. A comprehensive exploration of demographic, socioeconomic, and policing variables contributes to a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing fatal police shootings. Furthermore, the study seeks to identify any disparities in incident rates based on officers’ residency status, considering variables such as race, community demographics, and departmental policies.\nThe insights derived from this case study bear substantial implications for informing public policy, refining police training protocols, and strengthening community relations. By unraveling the nuanced dynamics surrounding police residence and fatal police shootings, this case study aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to enhance transparency, accountability, and trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.

    "text": "Each day researchers at The Post identify and manually record data for fatal police shootings in the United States. Each record requires at least two sources and must be approved by our editors before being publicly released.\nData about each fatal shooting is provided via two comma-separated value (CSV) files:\nDeath Record data for each victim and incident is included in /v2/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv.\nNew in v2 is a second Agencies csv, /v2/fatal-police-shootings-agencies.csv, which contains data for police agencies involved in at least one fatal police shooting since 2015. The agencies csv has a field called agency_ids, which can be used to associate each death record with the agencies involved.\nTo enable joining this dataset with other federal law enforcement datasets, in 2022 The Post undertook an effort to increase the coverage of federal Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) codes recorded for agencies in the database. Using agency data from the FBI and Department of Justice, reporters did a combination of automated and manual name and ORI code matching to fill in missing ORI code data. They also standardized department names. Agency naming, organization, hierarchy and classification varies from state to state. For this reason, sub-agencies and local troops, regions and posts have been aggregated into their parent agencies, meaning that in some cases an individual agency will have multiple associated ORI codes. For instance, a state police department may have the ORI codes of multiple barracks associated with it.\n\n\nThe Post created version 2 of this dataset in 2022 to refine and better define data categories, as well as improve documentation about how the data is obtained and classified.

    "section": "The Washington Post Fatal Force Database",
    "text": "The Washington Post Fatal Force Database\nIn 2015, The Washington Post began tracking details about each police-involved killing in the United States — the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the person was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by manually culling local news reports, collecting information from law enforcement websites and social media, and monitoring independent databases such as Fatal Encounters and the now-defunct Killed by Police project. In many cases, The Post conducts additional reporting.\nIn 2022, The Post updated its database to standardize and publish the names of the police agencies involved in each shooting to better measure accountability at the department level.\nThe 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. began a protest movement culminating in the Black Lives Matter movement and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. In this data set, The Post tracks only shootings with circumstances closely paralleling those like the killing of Brown — incidents in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths in this data set.\nThe FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. Since 2015, The Post has documented more than twice as many fatal shootings by police as recorded by federal officials on average annually. That gap has widened in recent years, as the FBI in 2021 tracked only a third of departments’ fatal shootings."
